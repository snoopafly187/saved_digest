Bacopa Monnieri has robust evidence backing it, but we all agree, that it isn't the cutting edge and most ridiculous memory-enhancing agent out there.

Common: [Runner] - building Straights decks deels like you're all in or bust, and feels good to get rewarded with a great scaler.Uncommon: [Glass Joker] - changes your mindset from "I hope this glass card doesn't break" to "IHope it breaks". Rare: [DNA] - just enables shenanigans. Legendary: [Triboulet] - the second I see this I always pivot.

I have honestly not found any Indian restaurant to stand out above the rest. Ppl say Rooh, Amber, Zareens and Amber but I wasn't impressed. Rooh feels like a restaurant that has high popularity due to the presentation of the food and the fancy style.
